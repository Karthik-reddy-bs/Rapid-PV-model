    "This is a simplified PV model which is used to rapidly and continuously forecast the potential and production of photovoltaic energy at the neighbourhood and city scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "----------\n",
    "This model was developed using LiDAR and DSM data. Forty simulation areas have been generated in which 25 training areas are used to analyze the relationships between PV power production potential and urban forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later parametrized equations, namely placement efficiency and geometric efficiency are generated from the training areas, which were later evaluated using the evaluation areas. Placement efficiency was used to accurately calculate geometrically placed PV panels for an urban area without actually placing PV panels on rooftop building segments. Geometric efficiency calculates the PV power output with shading losses instead of using the SEBE model. \n",
    "\n",
    "These parametrized equations are used in Big PV model. With the placement and geometric efficiency, PV power output for an urban area can be calculated in a simple and fast manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "----------\n",
    "1. With fewer input parameters, can rapidly estimate the PV potential over an entire year.\n",
    "2. Parametrized equations used in this model assist in calculating geometrically placed PV panels and account for shading losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "----------\n",
    "1. Assumes all rooftop building segments are equipped with PV panels neglecting safety, socio-economic and environmental factors.\n"

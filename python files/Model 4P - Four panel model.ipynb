    "Introduction:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Four-Panel Model (Four panels per grid cell, 4 orientations): In this model,for each time-step the power output is calculated from four tilted PV panels per grid cell. They are oriented towards North, East, South and West with a user-selectable and optimizable slope. The model separately considers flat and pitched roofs. For the flat roofs, PV panels are considered South facing for power output estimation with optimised slope. For pitched roofs, the summed PV power output of the four panels (equally oriented in four cardinal directions) is used. The PV power output from flat and pitched roofs are scaled using the respective projected roof area and totalled over the grid cell to calculate a total idealized PV power output. Finally the output is reduced due to effects of geometric placement and shading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "This model was developed using LiDAR and DSM data. Forty simulation areas have been generated in which 25 training areas are used to analyze the relationships between PV power production potential and urban forms and later the relationships were evaluated using 15 evaluation areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parametrized parameters, namely placement efficiency and shading efficiency are generated from the training areas. Placement efficiency was used to accurately calculate geometrically placed PV panels for an urban area without actually placing PV panels on rooftop building segments. Shading efficiency calculates the PV power output with shading losses instead of using the SEBE model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "1. With fewer input parameters, can rapidly estimate the PV potential over an entire year.\n",
    "2. Parametrized equations used in this model assist in calculating geometrically placed PV panels and account for shading losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions/Limitations:\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "1. Assumes all rooftop building segments are equipped with PV panels neglecting safety, socio-economic and environmental factors.\n",
    "2. Placement efficiency loss was calculated based on a standard PV panel having dimensions (1m x 1.6m)\n",
    "3. PV panels are tilted to an optimal angle of 40 deg and on flat roofs two rows of PV arrays are seperated by 1.5 m\n",

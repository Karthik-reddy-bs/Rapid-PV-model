    "Introduction:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-panelModel: (One panel per segment, many orientations): In this model, only one panel per rooftop segment is modelled. It is based on detailed distributions information on the area, slope, and azimuth of all roof segments in a grid cell. Initially, PV power output for each rooftop segment is calculated separately considering the aspect, slope and area of the segment, but without considering shading and geometric placement issues in order to limit computational power requirements. The PV power output from all segments is totalled to return the idealized PV power for a grid cell. Finally, the output is reduced due to effects of geometric placement and shading (self-shading and object shading).\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "This model was developed using LiDAR and DSM data. Forty simulation areas have been generated in which 25 training areas are used to analyze the relationships between PV power production potential and urban forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later parametrized equations, namely placement efficiency and shading efficiency are generated from the training areas, which were later evaluated using the evaluation areas. Placement efficiency was used to accurately calculate geometrically placed PV panels for an urban area without actually placing PV panels on rooftop building segments. Shading efficiency calculates the PV power output with shading losses instead of using the SEBE model. With the placement and shading efficiency, PV power output for an urban area can be calculated in a simple and fast manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "1. With fewer input parameters, can rapidly estimate the PV potential over an entire year.\n",
    "2. Parametrized equations used in this model assist in calculating geometrically placed PV panels and account for shading losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions/Limitations:\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "1. Assumes all rooftop building segments are equipped with PV panels neglecting safety, socio-economic and environmental factors.\n",
    "2. Placement efficiency loss was calculated based on a standard PV panel having dimensions (1m x 1.6m)\n",
    "3. PV panels are tilted to an optimal angle of 40 deg and on flat roofs two rows of PV arrays are seperated by 1.5 m\n",

For the solar irradiance modelling, (Lindberg et al., 2015) solar radiation model named Solar Energy on Building Envelopes (SEBE) is used. SEBE is incorporated in Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (UMEP) (Sun et al., 2020) as a plugin for QGIS. It uses DSM to calculate pixel-wise potential solar irradiance on building rooftops, walls, and ground surfaces. It uses a shadow casting algorithm to generate shadows, which helps determine the shading losses on rooftop segments caused by neighbouring buildings and vegetation.
